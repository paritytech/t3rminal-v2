/**
 * The codec-2 host client — `@parity/product-sdk-host`, which wraps
 * `@parity/truapi` and speaks the Polkadot app's Rust core.
 *
 * Why a second client at all. The wire has two incompatible envelopes and no
 * in-band negotiation between them:
 *
 *   codec 1  `@novasamatech/host-api` 0.12 — the native container that every
 *            release build of the phone apps, Desktop and dot.li still runs.
 *   codec 2  the TrUAPI Rust core — the default in Android debug builds and
 *            iOS nightly, both pinned to core 0.16.
 *
 * A codec-1 client gets no answer from a codec-2 host and vice versa, so the
 * terminal has to carry both and pick one per launch. `isTruApiRuntime()`
 * makes that choice (lib/host/detect.ts).
 *
 * **Everything here is loaded lazily, and that is load-bearing.** Both
 * clients claim `window.__HOST_API_PORT__.onmessage` the moment their
 * transport module evaluates — the legacy wrapper does it at import time, in
 * `sandboxTransport`. Two live transports means the second silently eats the
 * first one's replies, which looks exactly like a host that stopped
 * answering. So neither client is imported at module scope anywhere: each
 * path awaits its own loader, and only the path in use ever evaluates.

 * Adopting beats connecting. Newer cores construct the TrUAPI client in the

 * `__HOST_API_PORT__` MessagePort behind only as a compatibility path for
 * older SDKs. Taking their client means the wire codec is whatever the two
 * halves of the host already agreed on, so the terminal stops caring which
 * codec version this build of the app happens to ship — the failure mode this
 * whole migration exists to avoid.
 *
 * `setTruApiClient` lives on the SDK's `/testing` entry because its intended
 * use is a fake in a test, and it warns when called from a production build.
 * There is no other seam for adoption today; the warning is the price and it
 * is worth asking the SDK owners for a supported one.
 *
 * Safe to call repeatedly — one module instance per session, so one transport
 * and one set of port handlers.
