/**
 * Host NFC bridge — lets the terminal present the *payment* deeplink over NFC
 * (Host Card Emulation) so a customer can tap their phone instead of scanning
 * the payment QR. The payload is the exact same deeplink encoded in that QR
 * (e.g. `polkadotapp://pay/cheque?id=…&amount=…&key=…`), passed verbatim — no
 * transformation — so the customer's phone opens the Polkadot app identically.
 *
 * Scope: PAYMENT ONLY — the cheque deeplink first shown to the customer to pay,
 * never the printed receipt.
 *
 * The capability lives on the same frozen `window.host.ext` object as `printer`.
 * `present` only exists on hosts built with the NFC bridge (this Sunmi/nightly+);
 * on Desktop / dot.li / older builds it is absent, so we feature-detect and fall
 * back to QR-only. There is no `isAvailable()` — "availability" is simply whether
 * the binding exists.
 *
 * Host contract:
 *   - present(uri): arm NFC with this deeplink (emit it on tap until clear()).
 *   - clear(): disarm / empty the tag.
