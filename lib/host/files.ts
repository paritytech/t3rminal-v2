/**
 * Host file-save bridge — hands a generated file (receipt PDF, sales-report CSV,
 * SVG, log dump) to the native host, which writes it to the device Downloads
 * folder via MediaStore.
 *
 * Why this exists: inside the Polkadot host the terminal runs in an Android
 * WebView, which silently drops the usual `blob:` / `<a download>` download — so
 * nothing ever landed on the device. Routing the bytes through the host makes
 * downloads work in the WebView and inside kiosk Lock Task.
 *
 * Lives on the same frozen `window.host.ext` object as `printer` / `nfc`. `save`
 * only exists on hosts built with this bridge (this Sunmi/nightly+); on Desktop /
 * dot.li / older builds it is absent, so callers feature-detect and fall back to a
 * browser download. There is no isAvailable() — availability is whether the
 * binding exists.
