/**
 * Build-time feature flags.
 *
 * Gates what shows up in the UI so we can ship the simplest terminal (enter an
 * amount, the customer pays) while the code for the bigger features stays in
 * the tree, ready to come back. Flip a constant here (or set the matching
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_* var for one build) and the gated UI reappears —
 * nothing else to wire up.
 *
 * Static export inlines `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` at build time, so these
 * are constants in the bundle: a flag can't change at runtime, and the
 * bundler drops the branches behind a `false` flag.
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_BECOME_MERCHANT=1 npm run build
 *
 * Accepted values: "1" / "true" turn a flag on, "0" / "false" turn it off,
 * unset falls back to the default given here.
