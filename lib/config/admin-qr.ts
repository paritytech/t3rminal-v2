/**
 * T3rminal-side admin QR ingest helpers.
 *
 * The terminal scans a single QR from the W3sPay admin and gets back
 * everything it needs to operate against this merchant:
 *
 *   - the full item catalog (mapped into `lib/items/catalog`),
 *   - the merchant/display/payout binding (persisted as settings),
 *   - the report password derived by the admin (kept locally so future
 *     report encryption can recover it without re-prompting).
 *
 * Decode + multipart reassembly is delegated to the shared
 * `@/lib/config/t3rminal-config-qr` package — this module only owns
 * persistence and the catalog hand-off. Scanner failures are surfaced
 * as `null` results, never thrown exceptions, so the UI can show a
 * recoverable error instead of crashing the route.
